/**
 * Turns raw {@link TofGestureEvent}s into a debounced, display-ready gesture.
 *
 * <p>JJSDK already emits one event per edge of each gesture bit, so a hold produces exactly one
 * {@code ACTION_RECEIVED} followed by one {@code ACTION_CLEARED}.  The debounce here therefore
 * only guards against a bit that chatters, and it is deliberately keyed on the
 * (action, gesture) pair: keying on the gesture alone would swallow the {@code ACTION_CLEARED}
 * that immediately follows a short flick and, worse, hide a genuine repeat.
 *
 * <p>Every raw event is logged before the debounce runs, so "no gesture at all" and "gesture
 * received but filtered" can never be confused during on-device verification.
